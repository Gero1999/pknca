# Half-Life Calculation with Tobit Regression

Typical half-life calculation uses curve-stripping semi-log regression of the
natural logarithm of the concentration by time.  Based on the use of the
logarithm of the concentration, concentrations below the limit of quantification
which are set to zero are ignored.

Tobit regression allows inclusion of the concentrations below the limit of
quantification in the half-life calculation.  Tobit regression for half-life is
equivalent to using Beal's M3 method in population pharmacokinetic (PK) models.
