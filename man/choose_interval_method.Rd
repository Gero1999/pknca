concentration interval}
\usage{
choose_interval_method(conc, time, tlast, method, auc.type)
}
\arguments{
\item{conc}{Concentration measured}

\item{time}{Time of concentration measurement (must be monotonically
increasing and the same length as the concentration data)}

\item{tlast}{Time of last concentration above the limit of quantification
(will be calculated, if not provided)}

\item{method}{The method for integration (either 'lin up/log down' or
'linear')}

\item{auc.type}{The type of AUC to compute.  Choices are 'AUCinf', 'AUClast',
and 'AUCall'.}
}
\value{
A character vector of methods for interpolation/extrapolation methods
  that is the same length as `conc` which indicates how to
  interpolate/integrate between each of the concentrations (all but the last
  value in the vector) and how to extrapolate after `tlast` (the last item in
  the vector).  Possible values in the vector are: 'zero', 'linear', 'log',
  and 'extrap_log'
